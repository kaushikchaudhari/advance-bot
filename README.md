# KoyomiBot

A Bot that has a lot of random stuff... Provides a lot of different fun, unique commands.


## Goals

- Be 100% SFW, no worry about nsfw vs sfw content.
- Progress tracking. Some sort of profiling that will keep track of user activity.
- Perhaps one day do some data analysis on how people talk. (Anonymous user data. Most likely will be a per-guild basis, with option to opt out.)
- Mostly to just be able to bring some life to your discord and help quick-search any type of data on the internet.

## Info

- Uses prefix `k>`. Staging bot will use `k!> for testing`

Mostly the bot only needs permission to talk.

If you give a #koyomilog channel that he can talk in, he will print some mod messages regarding people deleting or editing messages on your Guild.
