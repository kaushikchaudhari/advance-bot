# KoyomiBot

This bot is coded in such a way that is VERY SPECIFIC to my own configuration. I suggest people to not run their own instance of this bot. I will make a new bot framework for others who wish to create their own bots.

## Requirements

Requires the following:

* discord.py[voice]
* beautifulsoup4
* redis
* aiohttp
* psutil
* wikipedia

Also requires redis database.

Official Website: [gh-pages](https://xNinjaKittyx.github.io/KoyomiBot)

Official Server Support: [Discord Invite](https://discord.gg/Fzz344U)

Invite Link: [Invite](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=310366123759632385&scope=bot&permissions=0)
